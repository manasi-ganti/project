This project will:

Help teachers invite students to engage more with online teaching.
Help students analyze their own engagement in the lectures they are attending.
Help teachers analyze the average engagement in the lectures they are teaching.
Students can download an app that will

Analyze the live webcam video in real time.
Display the aforementioned actions/emotions during video calls by replacing the live webcam with a pre-recorded video of the user. Each video communicates a specific action/emotional indicator.
Return a report to the student with a breakdown of their engagement with the lecture.
Users need to start the utility on their laptop while they are attending a lecture. Once the lecture is done or earlier if they wish, they can stop analysis. Extension: the utility will stop itself when the meeting is over.

Install with: pip3 install vroom-pkg-mganti==0.1
